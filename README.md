# plan9-acme-themes
This is planâ€™s acme text editor, but it will use themes from rio-themes (https://ftrv.se/14) if they are installed.

Basically, this code is the functions from rio-themes, yanked out and dumped into acme. Currently it only reads the themes and execution. So if you change your theme, you will need to restart acme if you want it to reflect the new theme. If no theme is installed, then it defaults to traditional acme.
